 VARUN KUMAR.G The AI-Powered Personalized Marketing and Customer Experience system will be 
demonstrated to stakeholders, showcasing its features, performance improvements, and 
functionality. This demonstration highlights the system’s targeted marketing capabilities, 
real-time data analysis, security measures, and performance scalability. By the end of the demonstration, the system’s ability to handle real-world scenarios, ensure 
data security, and deliver targeted marketing content will be showcased to the stakeholders. Comprehensive documentation for the AI-Powered Personalized Marketing and Customer 
Experience system is provided to detail every aspect of the project. This includes system 
architecture, AI model details, code explanations, and usage guidelines for both users and 
administrators. All critical components of the system will be well-documented, providing a clear guide for 
future development, deployment, or system scaling. # Supply Chain Management Dashboard


## Overview

This project is a **web-based Supply Chain Management Dashboard** developed using **Python (Flask)** and **HTML/CSS**. It displays real-time data for key areas of the supply chain:
- **Suppliers**
- **Inventory**
- **Orders**
- **Deliveries**

The goal is to provide a simple, readable dashboard interface that centralizes essential supply chain data for monitoring and decision-making.

---

## Features

- Built using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework.
- Dynamic rendering of structured data using Jinja2 templating.
- Clean and responsive HTML/CSS design.
- Modular structure for easy expansion of suppliers, inventory, orders, and deliveries.

```

## How It Works

### 1. Flask Setup

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template_string
```

- We import Flask and `render_template_string` to serve HTML content directly from Python.

### 2. Data Definitions

```python
suppliers = [...]
inventory = [...]
orders = [...]
deliveries = [...]
```

- These are **Python dictionaries** representing each section of the dashboard. This simulates backend data (could later be replaced by database queries).

### 3. HTML Template

```python
html_template = """..."""
```

- A full HTML document embedded as a Python multiline string.
- Uses **Jinja2** templating syntax (`{{ variable }}` and `{% for %}` loops) to inject dynamic content.

### 4. Flask Route

```python
@app.route("/")
def dashboard():
    return render_template_string(
        html_template,
        suppliers=suppliers,
        inventory=inventory,
        orders=orders,
        deliveries=deliveries
    )
```

- Renders the HTML template and passes data dictionaries as context variables.

### 5. Running the App

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

- Starts a local web server with `debug=True` for development.

---

## HTML/CSS Highlights

- Structured into four main sections: **Suppliers**, **Inventory**, **Orders**, and **Deliveries**.
- Each section has a clean `table` with headers and dynamic rows.
- CSS provides a modern and professional look:
  - Light gray background
  - White card-style sections with shadows
  - Colorful headers for emphasis (`#3498db` blue)

## Key Concepts and Benefits

| Concept                     | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flask Web Framework        | Serves as the backend for routing and templating                           |
| Jinja2 Templating          | Allows embedding dynamic data into HTML                                     |
| Separation of Concerns     | Data, logic, and presentation are well-organized                           |
| Scalability                | Easy to integrate with databases or REST APIs later                         |
| Lightweight UI             | Minimal dependencies and fast loading                                      |
